# Firefox Plugin Requirements

## Need to have

### uBlock Origin

Duh

### Session Manager

- Backup config
- Save multiple sessions
- All windows
- Plays nice with panorama/tab groups

### Tab Groups

- Panorama mode
- Groups of tabs
- One window, multiple "views" or facets

- Also considered:
- [Simple Tab Groups](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/simple-tab-groups/)

#### Choice: Panorama Tab Groups

- Cause it's been updated in the last three months and seems to work well

### Tab Mix Plus

- Customize Tab behavior
- Rows

### Tampermonkey

- But what scripts?
-

### Compact Dark Style

## Maybe?

### Reddit Enhancement Suite

### Suspend tabs

- Similar to "The Great Suspender", if I haven't browsed it for awhile then suspend it
- Please don't fuck with sessions or groups

### User Style Stuff
